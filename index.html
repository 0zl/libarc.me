                Hey, I'm "2i" (born 2002). I'm supposed to be a coding enthusiast, but, I'm mostly a procrastination master. When I'm not putting off my projects, I love to write code and learn new things. Born into a not-so-rich family, I've learned to appreciate the simple things in life.
                <br /><br />
                Gaming is my escape, but I'm stuck in the past - I only enjoy games that can be modded to death. Yeah, I'm that guy who still plays old games because new ones are too pricey, and my laptop are using integrated graphics anyway (Intel HD 4000).
                <br /><br />
                I'm also a sucker for retro websites and classic designs. There's something about the simplicity that speaks to me.
                <br /><br />
                Welcome to lib-arc, my main hub for all my projects. It's a mess, but it's my mess. Thanks for visiting!
